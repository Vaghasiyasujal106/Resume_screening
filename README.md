# Resume_screening
This project demonstrates how to build an automated resume screening system using Python and NLP techniques. It processes resumes and predicts the most suitable job domain or category (e.g., Data Science, Web Development, Civil Engineering, etc.) using machine learning models trained on labeled resume text.
